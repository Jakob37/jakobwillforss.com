I am a mixed bag of bioinformatics, software development, statistics and a joy for teaching. I enjoy learning and doing, and I thrive when I can mentor others to do the same. I have been working as a bioinformatician supporting plant researchers, and I am wrapping up a bioinformatically oriented PhD where I have had the pleasure to interface with both software development and then immediately apply them in biological collaboration projects. Meanwhile, I have had the chance to teach in several bioinformatics, programming and statistics courses, and in several cases developed course materials and organized hands-on workshops.
