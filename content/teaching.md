I have been involved teaching in:

* The Bioinformatics master's programme, teaching Python programming and Sequencing technologies
* UNIX programming for biologists, a three day workshop developed by me and organized through PlantLink and NBIS
* Git programming for bioinformaticians, a 1.5 day workshop
* Hands-on workshops given through Meetup groups:
    * Git for data science
    * A gentle introduction to R Shiny
    * ggplot for bioinformatics

Beyond this, I have given lectures in basic statistics, amplicon sequencing and more.

To the furthest extent possible, I will try putting up these materials here.
