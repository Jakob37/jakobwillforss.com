# Introduction

Through my ventures into statistics, there have been several books inspiring me on the way. Here, I want to briefly mention three of the most influential (and by me - recommended).

# Head First Statistics

Long before I started using statistics regularly, I had two courses in introductory statistics. One of the classes was geared towards engineers and one for biologists. Both were very theoretical and probably gave a solid and very extensive grounding for how to do analysis. Unfortunately, not much of this knowledge stuck with me (I heard from many classmates that it was a shared experience). So when I later encountered things like 'normal distributions' and 'sampling', I was not entirely sure what it meant.

This book changed that. After discussing it thoroughly with two friends, we finally started getting a grip on the foundations of statistics. I enjoy its silly style and its very visual style.

# Statistics done wrong

After statistics became more habitual, and I gradually got comfortable with words like 'ANOVA' and 't-test', there were still many unknowns to step into. Cases where I did things using statistics which felt 'kind of right', but with a nagging feeling that I might have missed something.

After reading this book and discussing it thoroughly with one friend, I spotted many issues that I both could have had run into, and in a few cases - that I had run into. This book helped improve my PhD project. It should be mandatory reading for every PhD student doing biostatistics.

# Introduction to Statistical Learning (with applications in R)

Getting tired of hearing the buzzword 'machine learning' gets thrown around as the solution to all data problems? Having a rough idea what it is all about, but still quite fuzzy on how the different methods work, and what the bias/variance trade-off means?

I read this book twice with a friend, and it gave an understanding of what machine learning is all about that I had previously been lacking. It goes to some depth but tries steering clear of getting into too many details (its bigger brother  [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7) is the one you are after if you want more to bite into).

If "applications in R" sound offputting to you - don't worry. It is fully readable also with no knowledge in R., and if you are Python-literate, some nice people have rewritten considerable parts of the exercises in Python. [Here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) is one example.

# Final words

This list is not an exhaustive collection, but these books have been a valuable part of my learning at one time or another. If you have encountered books that have helped you get into statistics, I would be happy to hear!
