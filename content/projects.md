I have a range of programming interests that have touched on topics such as hackathons, Chinese study, game programming and more. I plan to gradually put up summaries of the different projects I have been involved in here.

# Bioinformatics software development

**NormalyzerDE** is a [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00523) software for informed selection of normalization methods. It provides an 'evaluation report' guiding the user to select among a collection of normalization techniques. It provides a new approach to normalizing for electrospray intensity variations in the mass spectrometer. It has a built-in statistical module, which makes it easy to run the subsequent statistical step directly. It is available as a [web server](http://quantitativeproteomics.org/normalyzerde) an [R package](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomics/NormalyzerDE) and [Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NormalyzerDE.html).

**OmicLoupe** is a software for rapid and comprehensive visualization of trends in omics-data. It provides interactive visualizations and introduces novel visualizations for understanding trends across multiple datasets, omics, or statistical comparisons. It is freely available as an [open-source R package](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomics/OmicLoupe) and will be submitted for publication shortly.

# Bioinformatics analysis projects

During my Ph.D. I have been involved in three diverse agricultural projects, each using proteomics and, in some cases, transcriptomics to improve on the existing knowledge and breeding markers.

***Fusarium*** infection in oat: Proteogenomic exploration of the differing disease response between two oat varieties ([published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32061841/))

**Bull fertility**: Proteomic exploration across four separate proteomic datasets taken from seminal plasma in bull (submitted).

**Potato latitude adaptability**: Proteomic exploration across 17 potato-varieties grown 2016, and one variety is grown three Summers to find markers related to what makes some potatoes better handle the longer sun-hours and shorter growing seasons in northern Sweden (submitted shortly).

# Game development

**From Earth to Earth** is a [freely available online](https://jakob37.itch.io/from-earth-to-earth-beta) short game where a mud-man explores a rainy world searching for his Purpose. It is developed in C# and Unity. All code and assets are created by me. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/Jakob37/FromEarthToEarth).

**The Sun Will Go Out** is a [freely available](http://www.linkpact.com/games/tswgo/index.html) space exploration and role-playing game developed over more than two years, in a joint effort between three developers. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/LinkPact/The-Sun-Will-Go-Out).
